# Webapp for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1

This repository contains a complete implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 for generating responses from a custom dataset. The main file `app.py` sets up a Flask web server to provide an interface for querying the RAG model.

## Setup

Set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies. You can do this using the following steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages. You may use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start the Flask web server and interact with the RAG model, run the following command:

```bash
nohup python app.py &
```

This will start the server locally on `http://localhost:3000/`. You can now visit this URL in your web browser to access the interface or if you are running this implementation in a remote machine, you can visit `http://<your-remote-ip-address>:3000/`.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /query**: This endpoint accepts a query string as a parameter (`message`) and returns the response generated by the RAG model. Example usage:

  ```bash
  http://localhost:3000/query?message=your_query_here
  ```

## Main File Explanation

The `app.py` file contains the main implementation for setting up the Flask web server and integrating the RAG model. Here's a breakdown of its components:

- **Initialization Functions**: 
  - `initialize_llm`: Initializes the LlamaCPP model with specified parameters.
  - `initialize_query_engine`: Initializes the query engine for executing queries with the RAG model.

- **Flask App Routes**:
  - `/`: Renders the `index.html` template.
  - `/query`: Accepts a query string and returns the response generated by the RAG model.

- **Main Function**:
  - Initializes the LlamaCPP model and the query engine.
  - Starts the Flask web server.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that you have the necessary models and resources available in the specified paths.
- Customize the configuration and parameters according to your requirements.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue or contribute to the repository.
